IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT: DO NOT USE!

A module for streaming videos over HTTP using Node.js and FFMPEG.

FFMPEG is used to transcode the videos into http streaming compatible formats, and is obviously not required if the video in question is already in that format. 

The main focus of this project is to present a live video stream to the browser from a Webcam using Node, HTML5, HTTP and FFMPEG.
